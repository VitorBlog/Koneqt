> A blatant copycat of [Bento](http://bento.me/) and [Linktree](http://linktr.ee/), but with the audacity to improve things.

## 🚀 What is Koneqt?
🚧 **Koneqt is still in development and not available online yet. Stay tuned!** 🚧

Koneqt is a simple yet powerful link management tool designed to help users consolidate their online presence. Like its *"inspirations"*, it allows you to create a personalized landing page for all your links—but better (or at least, that's the goal). Whether you're an influencer, a content creator, or just someone who has way too many social media profiles, Koneqt makes it easy to share everything in one place.

## 🎯 Features
- [ ] 📌 **Profiles** – Base components and style.
- [ ] 📊 **Dashboard** – Create and personalize your link page with ease.
- [ ] 🎨 **Themes & Styling** – Choose from built-in themes or customize theme.
- [ ] 📊 **Analytics** – Track clicks, engagement, and visitor stats to optimize your page.
